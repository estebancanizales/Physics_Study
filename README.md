# Physics Learning Workspace

This workspace contains materials to learn undergraduate and introductory theoretical physics.

Structure:

- `syllabus.md` — course outline and suggested schedule
- `notebooks/` — interactive Jupyter notebooks with examples and exercises
- `resources/` — references, textbooks, and online links
- `requirements.txt` — Python packages for running notebooks

Quick start

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start Jupyter Lab and open the first notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Enjoy learning — tell me which topic to start next.
