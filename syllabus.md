# Syllabus — Theoretical Physics Roadmap

This syllabus is a flexible roadmap for undergraduate-level theoretical physics. Adjust pacing to your background and weekly availability.

Core mathematical preparation

- Calculus (single- and multi-variable)
- Linear algebra
- Ordinary differential equations
- Partial differential equations
- Complex analysis (intro)
- Fourier transforms and distributions

Core physics sequence (suggested order)

1. Classical Mechanics — Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms
2. Electrodynamics — Maxwell's equations, potentials, radiation
3. Quantum Mechanics — wave mechanics, operators, perturbation theory
4. Statistical Mechanics — ensembles, thermodynamics, phase transitions
5. Special Relativity and introductory General Relativity
6. Mathematical Methods and Computational Physics

Advanced directions (optional)

- Quantum Field Theory — path integrals, canonical quantization
- General Relativity — tensor calculus, black holes, cosmology
- Condensed Matter — many-body methods

Assessment and practice

- Weekly problem sets (conceptual + calculations)
- Short coding projects and simulations
- Periodic self-check quizzes
